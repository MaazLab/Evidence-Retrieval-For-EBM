# Evidence-Retrieval-For-EBM


## Introduction
Welcome to the Evidence Retrieval For EBM repository. This research work focuses on developing an advanced system to assist medical practitioners, in retrieving evidence-based information relevant to diseases and treatments. The system aims to bridge the gap between formulated queries and retrieved documents by improving the relevancy and accuracy of the retrieved information.

## System Overview
The Evidence Retrieval System for EBM is designed to address the challenges faced in searching and evaluating a vast amount of medical literature. Our system incorporates the Patient Intervention Comparison and Outcome (PICO) framework, which is widely used to classify and identify patients' diseases. It consists of the following components:

1. **Relevance Ranking:** The first part of our system involves retrieving relevant research articles. We have designed a document relevance algorithm that considers the complexities of the medical domain in determining the relevancy of each document to the input query. This component helps ensure that the retrieved literature is directly related to the specified disease or treatment.

2. **Quality Ranking:** Once the relevant literature has been identified, the system employs a quality ranking algorithm to assess the quality of each article. Various attributes, such as author reputation, total citations, and publication year, are taken into account to determine the reliability and relevance of the literature.

3. **Evidence Finding:** With the ranking of relevant and high-quality literature complete, the system proceeds to identify relevant evidence. It extracts the PICO elements from the literature, which provides structured information about the patient's intervention, comparison, and outcome. These elements are then related to the input query, allowing the system to find specific evidence relevant to the query.

4. **Result Retrieval Based on Evidence:** The final phase of our system involves retrieving the results based on the evidence found during the previous steps. By considering the evidence and the relevance and quality rankings, the system presents the most appropriate and reliable information to the medical practitioners.

## Methodology
Our methodology follows the principles of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) and incorporates advanced information retrieval techniques. The system leverages the PICO framework to formulate queries and extract relevant evidence. The methodology can be summarized as follows:

1. **Query Formulation:** The system uses the PICO framework to formulate queries based on the specific issues or problems experienced by the patient. The formulated query contains the patient's intervention, comparison, and outcome details.

2. **Relevance Ranking:** The system applies a document relevance algorithm to rank the retrieved literature based on its relevancy to the formulated query. This algorithm takes into account the complexities of the medical domain, ensuring that the most relevant literature is identified.

3. **Quality Ranking:** After relevance ranking, the system employs a quality ranking algorithm to assess the reliability and relevance of the literature. Attributes such as author reputation, total citations, and publication year are considered in this ranking process.

4. **Evidence Extraction:** The PICO elements are extracted from the literature using the PICO format. These elements provide structured information about the patient's intervention, comparison, and outcome. The system identifies relations between these elements and the input query, facilitating the extraction of specific evidence.

5. **Result Presentation:** Based on the evidence found and the relevance and quality rankings, the system retrieves and presents the most appropriate information to the medical practitioners. This ensures that they have access to the latest evidence-based information relevant to the patient's condition.

## Ongoing Research
Please note that this research work is ongoing, and it will take time to complete. We are continuously refining and improving the system's components and algorithms to enhance the retrieval and ranking of evidence-based information. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards providing a robust and effective solution for evidence retrieval in EBM.

## Conclusion
The Evidence Retrieval For EBM repository aims to develop an

 advanced system that assists medical practitioners in retrieving evidence-based information relevant to diseases and treatments. By incorporating the PICO framework and employing sophisticated relevance and quality ranking algorithms, we strive to improve the accuracy and relevancy of the retrieved information. We welcome you to explore the code and accompanying documentation to gain a deeper understanding of our system's functionality and methodology.

**Note:** This repository represents ongoing research and may undergo frequent updates and improvements. We appreciate your interest and encourage contributions to further enhance the system's capabilities.
